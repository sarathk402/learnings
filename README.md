# learnings
- Never trust your career with just one person.
- You and only You are in charge of your career.
- Words mean nothing unless followed up by actions. Eg: You received great year end review but annual bonus is just average.
- If something is taking too long, then perhaps it indicates lack of intention. Just move on. It is never going to happen.
- Trust but verify - **Can't emphasize how important this is**. People say a ton of things to gain your trust. No harm in veriying the claims if they are indeed true.
- Always re-assess periodically say every 6 months and be honest with yourself.
	-	Do you feel comfortable talking to your manager about your career and growth?
	-	Do you notice that your ideas are being considered or ignored with no reason?
	-	Are you happy with what you have learned so far since last check point?
	-	Did you achieve any growth - can be more responsiblities or new challenges or simply promo
-	Traits of a good manager:
	-	Shows **genuine** empathy (very important)
	-	Periodically asks about what you want and not just what they want
	-	If he/she is not technical, but then trusts people who are technically good	
-	Traits of not-so-good manager:
	-	Lacks empathy. Eg: If you are sick or your family is sick, they don't ask how you are doing, instead is more interested in project status. Delivery is important and equally important are People
	-	1-1's are just project status updates and not about you. You have scrum, sprint planning and retro for that
	-	Micro-managing every one. Even those that are delivering on time. Indicates lack of trust.
	-	Who doesn't like to talk about career growth or coming with a plan to make it happen.
	-	Not defending the team. Eg: Throwing an engineer or team under the bus to save themselves.
	-	If he/she is not technical, but doesn't trust people who are technically good
	-	The following two are courtesy of my mentor. I wish I knew these two before:
	1.	Someone who is almost always nice to you and never suggests things to improve. This sounds counter-intuitive. But this usually means, they don't have your growth in mind. No one is perfect and everyone has room to improve and grow.
	2.	Someone who is growing, be in in the team or by changing teams but the team is not growing. Someone who is not mentoring or grooming leaders. This person is obsessed with their growth but not about their teams growth.
