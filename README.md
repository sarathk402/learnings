# learnings
- Never trust your career with just one person.
- You and only you are in charge of your career.
-	Words mean nothing unless followed up by actions.
-	If something is taking too long, then perhaps it indicates lack of intention.
-	Trust but verify - **Can't emphasize how important this is**
-	Always re-assess if you are in the right place periodically
	-	Do you feel comfortable talking to your manager about your career and growth?
	-	Do you notice that your ideas are being considered or ignored with no reason?
	-	Are you happy with what you have learned so far since last check point?
	-	Did you achieve any growth - can be more responsiblities or new challenges or simply promo
-	Traits of a good manager:
	-	Shows **genuine** empathy (very important)
	-	Periodically asks about what you want and not just what they want
	-	If he/she is not technical, but then trusts people who are technically good
-	Traits of not-so-good manager:
	-	1-1's are just project status updates
	-	Micro-managing (even when are delivering on time) - indicates lack of trust
	-	Not defending the team - Eg: Throwing an engineer under the bus when customers complain
	-	If he/she is not technical, but doesn't trust people who are technically good
